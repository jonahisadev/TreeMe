# TreeMe

A timber plugin for Spigot/Paper Minecraft servers. Works on 1.16. Grab a copy
for yourself on the [releases](https://github.com/jonahisadev/TreeMe/releases)
page.

**I built this for a friend, and do not intend to spend all of my free time
maintaining it. I would like to continue improving it, but I will not be making 
this a full time project.**

### Features

* Crouch to disable timber
* Accurately singles out trees
* No leaves? No timber.
* Get realistic drops from felled trees
* Does tool damage depending on how many logs are in the tree.
